# Display character(s):

`[display]*strings`, ex: `[display]character1.png character2.png`

Displays character images corresponding to the ongoing and forthcoming dialogues. Unlike the [show] tag, which introduces new character images in addition to existing character images, this tag will first clear any existing character images before introducing the designated character image(s).
