# End of Current Dialogue Branch

The `[end]` tag is used to mark the conclusion of the current dialogue branch. Once this tag is encountered, the program will recognize that the dialogue or narrative path has finished.

### Syntax

```
Me:
- I guess this is the end of the story.

[end]
```

By using `[end]`, you signal that no further dialogue or choices will follow in this particular branch, and the story can transition or conclude as necessary.
