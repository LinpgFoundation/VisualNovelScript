# New Scene

The `[scene]` tag is used to transition to a new scene by displaying a specified background image. This command clears the previous scene and introduces the new one, setting the stage for the next part of the story.

### Syntax

```
[scene]background_image
```

*background_image* is the filename of the image to be displayed as the new scene's background.

### Example

```vns
[scene]bg2.png
```

In this example, the background image `bg2.png` is loaded to start a new scene.
