# Language

The `[language]` tag defines the language used in the current dialogue script. Each script file must specify its language to ensure proper localization and presentation.

*language_name* represents the name of the language being used in the script (e.g., English, Japanese, etc.).

### Example

```vns
[language]English
```

In this example, the language for the script is set to English.
