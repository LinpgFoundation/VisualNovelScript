# Script ID

The `[id]` tag assigns a unique identifier to the current dialogue script file. Each script file must have a distinct ID to ensure proper identification and organization within the system.

### Syntax

```
[id]unique_identifier
```

*unique_identifier* is a string representing the unique ID for the script.

### Example

```vns
[id]1
```

In this example, the script is assigned the ID `1`, ensuring it can be referenced and managed uniquely.
