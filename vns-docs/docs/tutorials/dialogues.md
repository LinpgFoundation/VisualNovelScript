# Dialogues:

A Dialogue is structured as follows:

```vns
Character name:
- Dialogue text
- Additional dialogue text
```

Each section starts with the character's name followed by a colon. The dialogue lines are then listed with a hyphen and a space before each line. This clear structure helps maintain readability and ensures it’s easy to track the speaker throughout the script.

## Key Points:

- **Character Name**: Placed at the start of the dialogue block, followed by a colon.
- **Dialogue Line(s)**: Begin with a hyphen and space before each line of dialogue.
- **Consistency**: Using this consistent structure enhances the script’s flow and makes conversations easy to follow.

### Example:

```vns
Mabel:
- Hello, my name is Mabel!
- How are you doing today?
```

By adhering to this format, the script remains organized, making it simpler for readers to navigate through conversations and understand the speaker at all times.
