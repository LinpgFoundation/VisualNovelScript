# Dialogues:

A Dialogue is structured as follows:

```vns
Character name:
- Dialogue text
- Additional dialogue text
```

Each dialogue begins with the name of the character speaking, followed by a colon. Subsequently, the dialogue lines are presented with a hyphen and a space at the beginning of each line.

This format ensures clarity and consistency in representing conversations within the script. By adhering to this structure, it becomes easier for readers to follow the flow of dialogue and understand who is speaking at any given moment. Additionally, the use of consistent formatting aids in maintaining the script's readability and comprehensibility.

### Example:

```vns
Mabel:
- Hello, my name is Mabel!
- How are you doing today?
```
