### The Basics of VNS

VNS are written in a plain text file with the `.vns` extension. The script file contains a series of tags, which are used to specify the different elements of the visual novel, such as the characters, backgrounds, dialogue, music, and so on.

### What are tags?

Tags are the key component of the VNS. The tags are often written in the form of:

`[tag]`

Of course, there are many tags with value, which is in the form of:

`[tag]value`

The `[tag]` represents the kind of value you are trying to represent, and the value is, well, the value.
