# Comments:

```
// This is a comment explaining the purpose of the following code block.
// It helps in understanding the functionality of the script.
// Comments are essential for readability and maintenance.
```

Comments are lines of text in a script that are ignored during execution. They provide helpful annotations, making the code more understandable to developers, collaborators, and future maintainers. Typical uses of comments include explaining code logic, outlining TODOs, and offering relevant insights into the scriptâ€™s functionality or design.

# Notes:

```
# This is a note providing additional information about a specific dialogue.
# Notes are similar to comments but are intended for specific conversations or reminders.
# They are retained in the source file and can provide context for future modifications.
```

Notes serve a purpose similar to comments but are often targeted at specific dialogue instances or sections within the code. They can include explanations, insights, or reminders for developers working on the scripts. Unlike standard comments, which are typically ignored or removed during compilation or execution, notes will be processed and retained to provide ongoing context.
